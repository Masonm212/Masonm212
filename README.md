My name is Mason Matias and I am currently a Computer Science major at Bridgewater State University.
I want to focus more on artificial intelligence but I am interested in a variety of topics regarding computers.
I am currently learning the basics of coding. I have yet to go in depth on any specific field or area. 
I want to work on anything that will help me improve my skills on AI. 
Email me to work on something: m1matias@student.bridgew.edu
